To type, just type. All typed text is inserted. Line endings and page endings 
	are automatic. Use [RETURN] to end paragraphs. [PAGE] forces a page to end. [SHIFT]-[DOCUMENT] begins a new document. If you make a mistake, press [ERASE] 
	to backspace over it. The blinking cursor shows where text will be inserted; 
	the solid highlight accompanying the cursor shows what [ERASE] will erase.
To move the cursor, hold down a LEAP key, type whatever you want to find -- 
	a character, a word or phrase -- let go of the LEAP key after cursor leaps. 
	After cursor movement, [ERASE] erases text to the right of the cursor. 
	[UNDO] can undo leaping, erasing and most commands.
To highlight some text you want to do something with (such as print or erase),
	leap from one end of it to the other, then press both LEAP keys. To
	unhighlight, press and release either LEAP key. Toadjust the highlight, 
	tap either LEAP key repeatedly as needed, then press both LEAP keys again.
Commands do things to highlighted text. Labels on key fronts show other commands.
	To use these, hold down [USE FRONT], and, while you hold it, press command.
For more information: Hold [USE FRONT], press [EXPLAIN], and then the key you
	want to know about.
